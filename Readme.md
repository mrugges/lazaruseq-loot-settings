Spend less time selling and more time farming!

# Core Features

- Automatically mark items to be sold to vendor vs. bazaar 
- Force certain items to always be vendored regardless of bazaar stats
- Force certain items to never be sold to vendor

# Example Workflow

1. Run up to a vendor and run /autosell as usual
2. Wait for macro to finish
3. Run loot-settings-parser and note the output (what's bazaarable vs. what's vendor trash)
4. Run /autosell again if output in step 3 looks good
5. (optional) Go to your trader and offload items listed as bazaarable
6. (optional) Update force_vendor.csv with any items that you want to sell to vendor anyway
7. (optional) Update ignore.csv with any items you want to ignore in this process
8. Go back to farming!
